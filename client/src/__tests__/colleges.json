            "description": "Situated within a residential neighbourhood of Washington, DC, the American University (AU) is a private, coeducational, doctoral institution with a liberal arts curriculum.\nIts origins date back to the late 19th century, when the Methodist bishop John Fletcher Hurst bought 90 acres of farmland in order to build a non-sectarian national university.\nBy 1914, the AU was open for business and admitted its first class of 28 students – four of which were women.\nToday, the university retains many of its original characteristics, including a ‘global outlook’, ‘practical idealism’ and ‘passion for public service’. AU’s students are considered to be among the country’s most politically active.\nThe university is home to seven schools and colleges: the College of Arts & Sciences, Kogod School of Business, School of International Service, School of Communication, School of Professional and Extended Studies, School of Public Affairs and the Washington College of Law.\nIt offers 69 bachelor’s degrees, 73 master’s degrees, 11 doctoral degrees and 72 certificate programmes for both graduates and undergraduates, as well as over 100 study abroad programmes.\nAU boasts of having plenty to offer students outside of the lecture theatre, such as campus events, student organisations and clubs, residential learning communities and internships. It is known for its flourishing athletics scene and, as a member of the Patriot League, competes using the team name ‘American Eagles’.\nThe university’s Office of Campus Life is made up of 13 different departments, each designed to support students in different areas, from spiritual life to their academic studies. Its aim is to establish an environment on campus that encourages learning, development and success.\nIt also houses an extensive collection of international, political and local art, including a public museum and sculpture garden that can be found within its Katzen Arts Centre, as well as performance art spaces and rotating exhibitions.\n",

            "description": "Barnard College, based in New York City, was founded in 1889 in response to Columbia University's then-refusal to admit women onto academic programmes. Today, it stands as one of the oldest women's colleges in the world, and the only women's college in the city.\nWhen Columbia University became coeducational in 1983, Barnard College decided to remain legally and financially separate but affiliated with the university. This means that some selected academic and athletic programmes are combined. Students also have the chance to pursue elements of their education at the Juilliard School and The Jewish Theological Seminary.\nBarnard's 4-acre campus is based in Manhattan and is directly across from Columbia's campus and several other academic institutions are in the vicinity. \nBarnard offers courses in around 50 areas of study, primarily relating to the arts. However joint programmes within science exist when in conjunction with other universities. The most popular subjects on offer at the college are english, psychology, political science, economics, history, and biology.\nAn annual festival is held at Barnard Now called the Athena Film Festival, which is a celebration of women and leadership. It is a weekend of feature films, documentaries and shorts that highlight women’s leadership in real life and the fictional world. The four-day festival includes conversations with directors and talent and workshops for aspiring filmmakers.\nThe Barnard Library offers study space, librarians' offices, the zine collection – documents movements and trends in feminism in the form of personal work of artists, writers, and activists – and archives and special collections.\nStudent groups available at the college include: theatre and vocal music groups, language clubs, a freeform radio station called WBAR, a biweekly magazine called the Barnard Bulletin, community service groups, alongside many others.\nIn accordance with wider policies across the US, Barnard College issued a statement affirming its commitment to environmental sustainability, hoping to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2017. \nNotable alumni include Joan Rivers, the American comedian, actress, writer, producer, Anna Marie Quindlen, an American author, journalist, and award-winning opinion columnist at the New York Times, and Lauren Helen Graham, an American actress, producer and novelist, best known for her role in Gilmore Girls.\n",

            "description": "Berry College is a privately run liberal arts college in north west Georgia, USA. The college was founded in 1902 by Martha Berry who started educating the local children with bible stories. By 1902 she had decided to use land inherited from her father to found the Boys’ Industrial School with the aim of lifting local people out of poverty. In 1909 a girls school was added, and Berry became an accredited college in 1926.\nDue to Martha Berry’s tireless fundraising efforts the college received large donations of funds and land, as many as 30,000 acres. This land, covering fields, forests and a mountain mean that Berry boasts the largest contiguous college campus in the USA.\nBerry has several undergraduate degree programs offering qualifications in arts and social sciences, humanities and the sciences. There are also undergraduate and masters courses available in business and teacher training. The college comprises the schools of business, education, humanities, arts and sciences and the school of mathematical and natural sciences. The college currently has a couple of  thousand students, many of them from in-state, but despite this there are around 20 different foreign countries represented within the Berry student body.\nThe scenic campus and beautiful old buildings are often used for shooting movies and the campus has endless opportunities for hiking, camping and hunting. The portion of the campus containing the college’s English Gothic style academic buildings is designated as a wildlife refuge. There is also an extensive sports and leisure complex offering students facilities to train and relax in between classes.\n",

            "description": "Located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a private, global research university, and one of just 25 universities to be admitted to the World Economic Forum’s Global University Leaders Forum.\nIts motto is ‘My heart is in the work’.\nEstablished in 1900 by the famous industrialist Andrew Carnegie, initially as the Carnegie Technical Schools, the university became the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1912. In 1967 it merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, resulting in its present incarnation.\nCMU emphasises close collaborations between faculty and students to address scientific, technological and societal challenges, as well as making things ‘from art to robots’.\nThe university lays claim to many examples of ground-breaking inventions and pioneering research into brain science, data, start-ups and driverless cars, among others. It was the first institution (via professor Scott Fahlman in 1982) to create a ‘smile’ in an email.\nIts cohort numbers well over 13,000 students from 114 countries, and a faculty of more than 1,400.\nWith its strong focus on creating new things, CMS says that many of its students go on to join some of the world’s most successful companies. The Association of University Technology Managers has ranked it first among US institutions for start-up companies created per research dollar spent, between 2008 and 2012.\nAs well as its US locations in Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley, Carnegie Mellon has a campus in Doha, Qatar, and offers degree programmes in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and Latin America.\nCMU boasts many student traditions with a distinctly Scottish flavour that owe their heritage to its Scottish-American founder, Andrew Carnegie. They include celebratory bagpipe playing on campus and the kilt-wearing student marching band known as the ‘Band Without Pants.’\nThe university has been home to a total of 19 Nobel Laureates and is the recipient of a vast array of other prestigious awards.\n",

The town is nicknamed ‘Hardware city’ for its many manufacturing firms, including the headquarters of Stanley Black & Decker. The university itself is something of a commuter college, with over half of its students living off campus.\nThere are over 70 undergraduate programmes to choose from at Central. One of the most popular is the Civil Engineering B.S, which is recognised by the Engineering Accreditation Commission and a four year planned course will include elements of mathematics, computer graphics and mechanics. The Carol A. Ammon College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences offers B.A, B.S, and B.F.A degree programmes, such as Anthropology, Geography and History.\nThe Maloney Hall Theatre is used by training actors as part of the undergraduate Theatre program at Central, and the 2017 programme included a production of The Laramie Project, with tickets open to the public. CCSU also has a dedicated advisory service for Career Exploration, in which students can revive advice on an major or future employment considerations during their first semester.\nCCSU has a strong reputation in intercollegiate athletics, and sports teams are known as the Blue Devils. The men’s football team compete in the NCAA Division I and play their home matches at the 5,500 seater Arute Field in New Britain.\nActor Kenny Johnson, Miss USA winner Erin Brady, and Congressman John Larson attended CCSU, as did Erin Stewart, who upon her election to the New Britain mayoralty was the youngest female mayor in the United States.\nA CCSU study into racial disparity in the use of tasers by police was a first in the United States, and was featured in the Washington Post.\n",

Founded in 1819 it became known for its raft of esteemed alumni, and in 1903 Woodrow Wilson remarked that ‘there is a college down in Kentucky which has graduated more prominent men than has Princeton in her 150 years’. Centre’s political connections have continued into the modern era, hosting both the 2000 and 2012 vice presidential debates.\nCentre has over 35 major and minor courses for a student to choose from, as well as the opportunity to take a double major or dual degree programmes. Additional academic offerings include language courses in Japanese or Chinese, and there are twelve preparatory options for those wishing to gain a foundation for a professional school, such as pre-law, pre-med and pre-dentistry.\nKnown as the Colonels, Centre College plays 21 teams in the Southern Athletic Association. As well as competitive sports, Centre has an extensive intramural system offering sports such as soccer, tennis and basketball, and the Buck Fitness Centre contains cardiovascular equipment, free weights, and a running track.\nVice Presidents Adlai Stevenson and John Breckinridge both graduated from Centre College, as did justice of the Supreme Court John Marshall Harlan, and E. Patrick Doyle was studying at Centre when he orchestrated the largest slave uprising in Kentucky’s history.\nFor those flying into Kentucky, Centre offers an airport shuttle service between both Louisville and Lexington. Louisville is also the location of the world famous Kentucky Derby, and for those wishing to experience Kentucky’s culture closer to campus, Danville is home to the Pioneer Playhouse, the oldest outdoor theatre in the state.\n",

There are also affiliate campuses in Beacon NY and the state’s Capital Region. Founded in 1896, the university is named for American philanthropist Thomas Clarkson.\nAt Clarkson there are more than fifty avenues of study for students, in the sectors of Engineering, Business, Arts, Sciences, Education and Health. There is also groundbreaking research being undertaken at the five distinct scientific research centres at Clarkson, made possible through a $30 million grant to the university, the largest in its history. In 2016 Centre for Advanced Materials Processing presented its work at an international symposium in Lake Placid, NY.\nSince 2011, The Beacon Institute of Rivers and Estuaries has been a part of Clarkson University. At Beacon students can undertake scientific research into ensuring clean watersheds and waterways, and mitigating the human and natural impacts on rivers. Beacon is also closely affiliated with the Institute for a Sustainable Environment, based at Potsdam campus.\nA dedication to fitness and athletic competition are an important part of life at Clarkson. Varsity teams are known as the Golden Knights, and over 80% of students participate in at least one intramural sports team. Ice hockey is particularly prominent at Clarkson, with matches played at the 3,000 seater Cheel Arena and many alumni going on to play in the NHL.\nTV journalist Kaitlin Monte, German politician Katherina Reiche, and hockey player Todd Marchant are all alumni of Clarkson. Albert Bouchard and Buck Dharma, founders of rock band Blue Öyster Cult, dropped out of Clarkson to pursue music full time.\n",

Originally the Baptist Education Society of the State of New York, it was Madison University from 1846 until 1890, when it adopted its current name to thank the Colgate family for their dedication to the institution. William Colgate, one of the institution’s first trustees, founded what went on to become Colgate, the toothpaste manufacturer.\nLocated in the centre of the state, in the village of Hamilton, Colgate University is 200 miles north west of New York City, where regular buses run to. 575 acres in size, its rural hillside campus has been rated among the nicest in the country, dotted with around 90 buildings, some built as early as the 1820s, and more than 2000 trees.\nThe institution's undergraduate courses culminate in a Bachelor of Arts.\nOne of the university’s traditions involves first-years walking up the hill with seniors holding torches when they start their courses, and carrying torches themselves when they walk down at the end of fourth year before throwing them into a bonfire.\nIts student newspaper, the Colgate Maroon-News, is the oldest weekly at any US college, with its roots dating back to 1846.\nNotable alumni include Bruce Buck, the chairman of Chelsea Football Club, and Chase Carey, the chairman of Formula One.\n",

Students take eight blocks each academic year and 32 in the course of their four-year programmes. The plan is designed to enable students to gain experience of a wide range of areas, focusing on no more than one at any particular time. The intensive study and lack of subjects being taken simultaneously means that a semester’s worth of material is typically covered in one single block.\nCC is based in Colorado Springs, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, with views of the Rocky Mountains. It is Colorado’s second most populous city, 70 miles south of Denver, the largest city in the state and the capital, but it also has its own airport, which runs flights to more than 10 American cities.\nFounded in 1874, before Colorado had even become a state, and coeducational throughout its history, its first degrees were awarded in 1882. The campus has virtually been rebuilt from scratch since the 1960s.\nAlumni include Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani, the former prime minister of Yemen, James Heckman, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in econometrics, and David Jenkins, who won figure skating gold in the 1960 Winter Olympics.\n",

These include over 80 undergraduate majors, more than a dozen accelerated degree programmes, and around 120 degrees and certificates for graduates and professionals.\nThe university’s history dates back to 1891 when it was founded by the notable banker Anthony Drexel. It was originally known as the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry, renamed as the Drexel Institute of Technology in 1936 before taking the name Drexel University in 1970, which it goes by today.\nWith 15 schools and colleges, it is one of America’s top 15 largest private universities.\nMaintaining much of its original character and focus, Drexel’s Academy of Natural Sciences, over 200 years old, is the oldest major natural science museum and research organisation in America.\nAs part of its mission to prepare students for work outside of the lecture theatre, Drexel offers a co-operative education programme that most undergraduates participate in. Introduced in 1919 as one of the first of its kind, it allows students to combine their studies with paid, professional work experience.\nThe university has three campuses in Philadelphia: University City campus and Centre City campus are situated in lively, central areas, while the Queen Lane campus is slightly further out in a more residential district.\nOther university locations include the historic Academy of Natural Sciences and the Business College, located on the Malvern campus and catering for accelerated and part-time graduate studies. There is also a Drexel campus at the University of the Pacific in Sacramento, California.\nDrexel was the first major university in America to offer a fully wireless campus in 2000 and many of the courses offered by Drexel can be taken online. \n",

            "description": "Eastern Illinois University was founded as a teacher training school in 1895 under the name of Eastern Illinois State Normal School. The institution had multiple name changes as it broadened its curriculum and began offering degree programmes.\nThe university logo depicts Old Main, the oldest building on campus. It was designed by the architect George H Miller in the style of a medieval castle, with turrets and a rampart-like roof. It was opened in 1899.\nThe four colleges at the university are: Arts and Humanities, Business and Applied Sciences, Education and Professional Studies and Science.\nEnvironmentalism has a strong profile at the university. Its renewable energy centre provides electricity to the campus and is one of the country’s largest biomass fuel facilities. The university’s Clean Energy Research and Education facility’s mission is to enable students and staff to study new initiatives in renewable energy.\nCampus life is very active, with 180 student organisations and 30 sororities and fraternities. Clubs range from jive dance to Japanese animation and from Spanish to soccer.\nFamous Eastern alumni include the Chicago Bears manager Ryan Pace, journalist Ted Gregory and Vermont Supreme Court Justice Marilyn Skoglund.\nThe university is based in Charleston, Illinois. The decision to open the school in Charleston proved controversial with the nearby town of Mattoon, which had led the campaign to open a teaching school in the county. Mattoon residents resented the fruit of their labour being located in a different town.\n",

The university is divided into the College of Arts, Letters and Education, the College of Business and Public Administration, the College of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, the College of Social Science and Behavioural Sciences and Social Work, and the College of Health Science and Public Health.\nThe main campus is located in Cheney, with programmes in Bellevue, Everett, Kent, Seattle, Shoreline, Spokane, Tacoma and Vancouver. The Cheney campus is situated near Turnbull National Park, with mountains and rivers on its doorstep. The campus itself comprises 300 acres of parkland.\nThe university’s outdoor programme, EPIC Adventures, helps students take advantage of their location by renting out kayaks, camping gear, climbing equipment and snow-proof clothing. EPIC Adventures also runs backpacking and mountaineering trips.\nWhile Cheney itself is a small town, it’s a short distance from Spokane, Washington’s second largest city. Many students find internships in the city either during or after their study.\nEastern Washington competes in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the highest level of inter-college sport in America.\n",

In addition, the university has a study abroad centre in the United Kingdom, Spain and South Africa.\nTen different colleges make up Fordham University – four of which are for undergraduates while six are for postgraduates.

Moreover, it is also a depository for United States Government documents. \nFordham University is considered a research university and facilities are available on campus to facilitate this. Buildings include the Louis Calder Centre – a 114-acre biological field station – the William Spain Seismic Observatory, and a data collection unit for the US Geological Survey. Many faculty of Fordham have conducted research with other institutions across the country such as the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre.\nThrough the university’s international programmes, students have the ability to study abroad during their studies. More than 130 opportunities are on offer, which can range between six weeks and a full academic year. Partner institutions include Georgetown University, the University of Oxford, and the Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE).\nThere are over 20 sports teams at Fordham University which compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and play as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference. The men's basketball, in particular, has an impressive background boasting four NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship and 16 National Invitational Tournament appearances. \nThe university has its own student-run award-winning newspaper called The Observer, while The Ram is the university's journal of record, and the paper, which is a student-run free-speech publication.\nNotable alumni include Denzel Hayes Washington, Jr., an American actor, filmmaker, director, and producer, Vince Lombardi, an American football player, coach, and executive in the National Football League (NFL), and Mary Higgins Clark, an American author of suspense novels\n",

In 2012, U.S. News & World Report ranked it 46th among Best Liberal Arts Colleges in the US.

They are members of the NCAA Division III. Some 25 per cent of Gettysburg's students participate in intercollegiate programmes, which include twelve sports for men and twelve sports for women.\nIn 2008, the college built a new $25 million athletic centre – the John F. Jaeger Centre for Athletics, Recreation and Fitness – which featured a natatorium, complete with eight lanes and enough space for 350 seated spectators, a 10,000 foot weight and cardio room complete with flat-screen TVs, additional spaces for yoga, aerobics, spinning and martial arts classes and rock climbing walls.\nNotable alumni include Fred Fisher Fielding, an American lawyer who held the office of White House Counsel for US Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W.

            "description": "Hendrix College is an American liberal arts college in the city of Conway, Arkansas which is associated with the Methodist Church. The college was originally founded in 1876 as the Central Institute primary school in the town of Altus; in subsequent years education for older students was added including at the college level. In 1884 the school was purchased by members of the Methodist Episcopal Church and in 1889 the institution was renamed Hendrix College after the Rev. Eugene Russell Hendrix. At this time the university also began allowing women to enroll. The college moved from Altus to Conway in 1890 and since that time the college has continued to grow and add to its range of academic programs.\nToday Hendrix is home to roughly students from nearly 30 different countries studying a wide range of undergraduate courses. The college offers upwards of 30 undergraduate majors and around 40 minors for students to choose from. Hendrix students also have the opportunity to combine courses to create their own educational experience as part of the university’s Interdisciplinary Studies majors.\nThe suburban campus covers 175 acres in Conway and contains 36 major buildings. As well as the college’s academic and admin building the campus contains the student halls of residence as well as the college Wellness and Athletics Center which houses a swimming pool, basketball courts and gym. There is also an indoor running track as well as baseball and soccer fields. The university also has its own arboretum. \n",

The school grew to take in older students and eventually offer college level education and received a state charter in 1866. The first college class, comprising ten students, enrolled in 1862. The original pioneer school opened just four years after the settlement of Holland was founded. Hope College retains strong links with the Reformed Church of America and combines education within the Christian faith with high academic standards.\nToday Hope is a thriving private residential liberal arts college with an enrollment of students studying a wide range of undergraduate courses from Physics to Classical Languages. Courses are spread across five areas: General Education, Arts and Humanities, Natural and Applied Sciences, Social Sciences and Pre-Health Programs. The college offers more than 80 majors, minors and pre-professional programs as well as a variety of study abroad options of differing lengths.\nThe Hope College campus stretches over 125 acres in the heart of downtown Holland, reflecting the school’s historic relationship with the town. The majority of students live on-campus in the halls, apartments or cottages available. To mark the college’s 150th anniversary two new buildings were opened, the Jack H. Miller Center for Musical Arts and the Kruizenga Art Museum, both of which are open for use by all students and faculty.\n",

            "description": "Illinois College is a private liberal arts institution in Jacksonville, Illinois USA. The college was founded in 1829 by a group of seven students from Yale university, known as the ‘Illinois Band’ who had headed westwards with the intention of starting new places of higher education. The initial proposal for the college was made by missionary Rev. John M. Ellis who was a Presbyterian and it was Rev. Ellis who originally attracted the ‘Illinois Band’ to come to Jacksonville to help found the college there. The first two students graduated from the college in 1835 and one went on to become governor of the state while the other was a composer. Many influential writers, thinkers and politicians visited the campus to speak, including Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain and Oscar Wilde. The college was part of the abolitionist movement and its central building, Beecher Hall, is thought to have been part of the Underground Railroad, helping slaves to freedom.\nToday Illinois College is a thriving coeducational liberal arts college which retains its to the Presbyterian Church and the United Church of Christ. There are around one thousand students studying for undergraduate bachelor’s degrees. There are around 80 different programs on offer and students have the option of studying interdisciplinary or combined majors programs. The university also offers undergraduate research schemes for students who want to specialise in a unique interest or area of study during their time at Illinois College.\nThe college campus covers 80 acres in the centre of Jacksonville and is divided into two areas called the upper and lower quads. There are green lawns and tree lined walks linking historic college buildings. The campus has a coffee shop, library and fine arts centre as well as the usual academic, administration and residential buildings. There are also soccer pitches, softball fields and a gymnasium for students.\n",

In 1867 it became the fourth public university to admit woman on the same basis as men, with Sarah Parke Morrison becoming the first female IU student. The university continued to expand and extension campuses in Kokomo and Fort Wayne were opened in the 1940s, which are now part of the Indiana University system.\nThe 1,933-acre campus is located in Bloomington in central southern Indiana and many of the university buildings were built in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate the influx of students from America’s post-World War II baby boom.\nSome of the notable university buildings include the 17,000-seat Assembly Hall, the enormous Indiana Memorial Union, and the Herman B Wells Library, which holds more than 4.6 million volumes.\nThe university sports teams, known as the Hoosiers, participate in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and have won 24 NCAA national championships in a variety of sports including basketball, swimming and soccer.\nThere are more than 550 academic programs available to students, including over 200 undergraduate majors. IU Bloomington has 16 degree-granting schools and colleges as well as the University Graduate School, which has almost 200 academic programs at master’s and doctoral level.\nMore than 640,000 people have graduated from IU Bloomington over the years and many have gone on to become leaders in their respective fields.\nAmong notable alumni are co-founder of Wikipedia Jimmy Wales, composer Hoagy Carmichael, owner of the Dallas Mavericks Mark Cuban, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ernie Pyle, and Oscar-winning screenwriter Steve Tesich, whose film Breaking Away was shot on the IU Bloomington campus.\n",

However, Iona College’s student enrolment gradually started to increase and in 1950, 300 students graduated.\nToday the university is home to around 4,000 students, studying one of the 45 majors, 35 minors, or 30 graduate programs available. There are three major academic schools – the School of Arts and Science, the Hagan School of Business and the Rockland Graduate Center – all of which are divided into several smaller and departments.\nMost courses are four years long, although there are also five-year dual degree programs.\nThe 45-acre Iona College campus has several academic buildings in addition to extensive student housing options such as Rice Hall, East Hall, Conese and South Hall, Loftus Hall, and Eastchester Apartments, most which are divided into suites and dormitories.\nThere are over 80 clubs, fraternities and sororities on campus and the college sports teams, known as the Iona Gaels, are a member of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) and compete in 21 NCAA Division I programs.\nNotable former students include MASH actor Bud Cort, celebrity biographer Donald Spoto, former Deutsche Bank CFO Anthony Di Iorio, and New York State Senator John Bonacic.\n",

Between both campuses there are more than 100 student clubs, organisations, fraternities and sororities, many of which are based upon the idea of supporting the community.\nThere are eight residence halls on campus, three of which are designated for freshmen while the other five house upperclassmen.\nThere are just two main academic schools at JCU: the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Boler School of Business. Students of both schools must study a rigorous liberal arts core curriculum, which contains a lot of material central to the Jesuit principles. The College of Arts and Sciences offers 31 majors, while the Boler School of Business offers seven.\nThe vast majority of the JCU student population are undergraduates although there is a diverse set of master’s courses available too.\nThe university operates student exchange programs with several other Jesuit institutions as well as other universities across the world, including institutions in the UK, Japan and Germany.\nNotable former students include TV journalist Tim Russert, former American football coach Don Shula, who led the Miami Dolphins to the NFL’s only perfect season ever and after whom the JCU stadium is named, and HBO founder Charles Dolan.\n",

            "description": "Established in 1833 and one of the 100 oldest higher education institutions in the United States, Kalamazoo College (K College or K) is a private liberal arts college located in the city of Kalamazoo, Michigan.\nThe college was founded by a group of Baptist ministers and opened its doors in 1836. It operated as a branch campus of the University of Michigan between 1840 and 1850, but by 1855 the institution received an educational charter, becoming an autonomous college and taking its current name.\nToday, K College has study areas including humanities, physical education, fine arts, languages, social sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics. There are also interdisciplinary study programs available and K College offers courses such as African Studies, Film and Media Studies and Critical Ethnic Studies.\nThe 60-acre campus has a hilltop location in a quiet area of the city of Kalamazoo which houses the academic departments, a chapel, theatres, arts centres and several other facilities, while the college also owns a 135-acre arboretum. The campus is close to the city centre and is around 140 miles from Detroit and Chicago.\nThe college sports teams are known as the Hornets and compete in the NCAA Division III, fielding teams in 11 different sports.\nThe university tennis team is particularly prestigious, having won seven NCAA Division III national championships.\nNotable former students include The Walking Dead star Steven Yeun, artist Julie Mehretu, Japanese author Kafū Nagai, and businessman Ty Warner, the founder and owner of Ty Inc.\n",

            "description": "Among the largest of the 29 members of the University System of Georgia, Kennesaw State University (KSU) is a public, coeducational university with campuses in Kennesaw and Marietta, Georgia.\nKSU was established in 1963 as the Kennesaw Junior College with an initial enrolment of just over 1,000 students. In the years that followed the university underwent massive growth, becoming Kennesaw State University in 1996, the same year that the KSU baseball and softball teams won the NCAA Division II national championships.\nIn 2015, the Southern Polytechnic State University and KSU merged under the guidance of the Georgia University System, taking the latter’s name and bringing two of the state’s most respected institutions together. Following the merger there are now 13 academic colleges offering a combined total of more than 150 undergraduate and graduate degrees, as well as a growing number of doctoral qualifications.\nThe 240-acre main campus features some particularly notable buildings, including the Social Sciences building which is home to a 302-seat auditorium, 40 classrooms, and a cinema classroom. There is also the Dr. Bobbie Bailey & Family Performance Center, which houses a 630-seat auditorium and a rehearsal hall.\nThe KSU Athletic teams, known as the Kennesaw State Owls, participate in the NCAA Division I in a large range of sports including basketball, golf, cross country and tennis. The university only moved to the Division I in 2006 and have already finished as a runner-up in a baseball championship, in 2012.\nNotable former graduates include golfer Larry Nelson, TV host Ty Pennington, radio personality and TV host Ryan Seacrest, and former Senator of Colombia Arturo Char Chaljub.\n",

            "description": "Focusing on research and STEAM fields, Lawrence Tech is a higher learning institute based in Southfield, southeast Michigan. The university was established in 1932 by the Lawrence brothers, and was based in Highland Park until 1955.\nThe four colleges of Lawrence Tech are Architecture & Design, Arts & Sciences, Engineering, and Management. An original motto of Lawrence Tech was ‘theory and practice’, and this belief is incorporated across courses. The college of Engineering, dating back to the university’s establishment, has conducted applied research with state and federal governments.\nLawrence Tech also has numerous facilities in nearby Detroit, the largest city in the state and regarded as the car manufacturing centre of North America. The Detroit Studio united design professionals with community outreach programmes, collaborating with around 2000 participants in over 50 studio projects, and has been granted the AIA Michigan President’s Award.\nFounded in 2006, the International Design Clinic has been dedicated to much needed design projects across the globe, such as a play area for Romanian orphans made from construction materials, and a water filter costing just $2.\nAlumni of Lawrence Tech include architect of Comerica Park, John Buffone, former CEO of Microsoft Steven Ballmer, inventor of the bar code scanner Ronald Knockeart, and John DeLorean, whose model of automobile was famously featured in the Back To The Future trilogy.\nAthletics teams at LTU are known as the Blue Devils, competing in the university colours of blue and white. There are eleven men’s varsity teams and nine women’s, and two co-ed teams of Dance and Pep Band.\n",

It is located between the Hudson River and Van Cortlandt Park, NYC’s third biggest. Initially a commuter college, it is now primarily residential, but the city centre remains easily accessible by public transport.\nA private Catholic institution in the Lasallian tradition with six schools in total, a high proportion of its students are from ethnic minorities.\nEngineering, business, civil engineering, biology, management and childhood education are among the most popular undergraduate programmes, though Manhattan also runs a number of courses for postgraduates. \nIts most famous alumnus is either Rudy Giuliani, the lawyer-turned-politician and two-term mayor of New York City briefly dubbed “America’s mayor” for his well-received speeches in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, or James Patterson, the writer who has sold more than 300 million books from the Alex Cross, Maximum Ride, and Daniel X series. Chang Myon, twice Prime Minister of South Korea, and Glenn Hughes, a founding member of Village People, also went to Manhattan College.\n",

            "description": "The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is an independent, coeducational, private research university based in the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nEstablished in 1861, MIT aims to ‘further knowledge and prepare students in science, technology and other fields of study that will best benefit the nation and the world today’. Its motto is Mens et Manus, which translates as “Mind and Hand”.\nThe university lays claim to 85 Nobel Laureates, 58 National Medal of Science winners, 29 National Medal of Technology and Innovation winners and 45 MacArthur Fellows. Among its impressive alumni is Kofi Annan, former secretary-general of the United Nations.\nScientific discoveries and technological advances accredited to MIT include the first chemical synthesis of penicillin, the development of radar, the discovery of quarks, and the invention of magnetic core memory, which enabled the development of digital computers.\nMIT is currently organised into five different schools: architecture and planning, engineering, humanities, arts and social sciences, management and science.\nIt is home to around 1,000 faculty members and over 11,000 undergraduate and graduate students. MIT’s current areas of research include digital learning, sustainable energy, Big Data, human health and much more.\nIn addition to its emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, MIT also boasts a diverse and vibrant campus environment with a wide array of student groups. The campus is arranged over 168 acres within Cambridge, and features 18 student residences, 26 acres of playing fields, 20 gardens and green-space areas, as well as over 100 public works of art.\nMIT estimates that all its living alumni have between them launched more than 30,000 active companies, created 4.6 million jobs and generated roughly $1.9 trillion in annual revenue.\nTaken together, this ‘MIT Nation’ is equivalent, they say, to the 10th-largest economy in the world.\n",

MSU was founded with the aim of providing training in “agriculture, horticulture and the mechanical arts … without excluding other scientific and classical studies, including military tactics.” \nTo reflect the broadening of its areas of study and research, the name was changed to Mississippi State College in 1932, and then to Mississippi State University in 1958.\nToday, MSU is comprised of eight Colleges, spread throughout Starkville and its satellite campuses in Meridian, Biloxi and Vicksburg: Agriculture and Life Sciences; Architecture, Art and Design; Arts and Sciences; Business; Education; Engineering; Forest Resources; and Veterinary Medicine.\nOn the 4,200 acres of grounds, there are plenty of farms, pastures, woodlands. The 560-acre MAFES Plant Science Farm and the 1,560-acre MAFES Animal Sciences Farm are home to much of the university’s agricultural research.\nThere are various off-campus buildings which also form part of the university. Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station has 16 branches, spread throughout the state. There is also an off-campus centre in Meridian, and The Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, which both run undergraduate and graduate degree programmes. The engineering college offers a master of science degree in collaboration with the US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station in Vicksburg.\n",

            "description": "Moravian College is among the oldest operational education institutions in the United States, tracing its history all the way back to before the country gained independence. In 1742 the Countess Benigna von Zinzendorf travelled to the then-colony of Pennsylvania and established the territory’s first girls’ boarding school, called Bethlehem Female Seminary. The Countess and the school shared a Moravian faith, a branch of Christianity known for following the principle that all humans should receive an education, regardless of social status or gender.\nIn 1954 the girl’s school, which had become a college, merged with a local men’s college and became Moravian College.\nMoravian College follows the liberal arts tradition, with a core curriculum designed to give students a foundation on which to build their career. All students take part in a first year writing seminar designed to teach critical reading and writing skills.\nBachelor’s of arts, sciences and music degrees are available at the college, as well as master’s degrees in subjects such as divinity. The college also offers a Peace Corps prep programme.\nIn its early years, Bethlehem Female Seminary was attended by the two nieces of George Washington, at his request. More recent alumni include the socialite Florence Foster Jenkins, Democratic Party Assembly Majority Leader Louis Greenwald and NASCAR driver John Andretti.\nMoravian College is located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The twin campuses sit in the historic old town, where 18th century buildings, vintage shops and modern bars sit side-by-side. Nearby, the cities of Allentown and Easton provide internship and work opportunities for graduates.\n",

            "description": "Mount Holyoke College was the first of the Seven Sisters – prestigious liberal arts colleges for women on the East Coast of the United States. At a time when education was male-dominated, founding Mount Holyoke was a great step forward. The Seven Sisters became known as the female equivalent of the (formerly all-male) Ivy League. Mount Holyoke is one of five of these colleges to remain a women’s college.\nThere are over 50 majors on offer at the college, along with the option to design your own major. As a liberal arts college, Mount Holyoke requires students to study outside of their major, giving a broad education in arts, sciences and humanities. Students are also required to study a foreign language and a multicultural perspectives course.\nMount Holyoke has been sister college to the Women’s Christian College in Chennai, India for around 100 years. \nSince 2014, Mount Holyoke has explicitly accepted transgender women and people with non-binary gender identities as students.\nThe campus at Mount Holyoke is very large given its population, with 800 acres encompassing lakes, waterfalls, a botanic garden, riding trails and stables.\nSeveral of Mount Holyoke’s alumni have broken new ground for women in their careers after college. They include Secretaries of Labor Frances Perkins and Elaine Chao, who were respectively the first woman and first Asian American woman in the US Cabinet.\nOther notable Mount Holyoke alumni include the poet Emily Dickinson, producer Debra Martin Chase and anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar.\n",

It grants a significant amount to students in financial aid annually, in addition to generous funding for research.\nThe institution, which itself has a significant endowment, is perhaps most famously associated with its undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in social science, dentistry, nursing and fine arts.\nWith campuses on two continents from New York to Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, the university’s affiliates officially operate in 25 countries around the world. Locally, the university’s New York campus is formed of over 20 colleges and schools placed at 5 different locations in and around New York, such as Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn.\nThe main campus, located in the heart of Lower Manhattan in the vicinity of Sixth Avenue and Washington Square Park, covers 1 km² of land. It offers guaranteed housing options to freshmen, who may find themselves among the 11 thousand visitors who explore the Bobst library, one of the 11 libraries operated by NYU.\nNew York University’s alumni have received a number of Nobel and Crafoord Prizes, as well as several Pulitzer Prizes and Abel Prizes in the past.\nAfter having the Violet for its official mascot for a century, the university introduced the Bobcat, an extinct species of big cat related to the puma. It symbolises the combination between the university’s academic achievement and success in sport activities.\n",

            "description": "When it opened for business in 1855, Northwestern University had only two academic staff and 10 students. These were all male, but women have been admitted since 1869.\nNorthwestern owes its existence to the vision of its nine founders who, with no land, limited finances and little knowledge of higher education, determined to create a university for the vast Northwest Territory covering more than five of today’s states. They began planning in 1850 and, three years later, boldly went ahead and purchased a 379-acre site close to Lake Michigan and developed the campus at Evanston, named after a founder called John Evans.\nFrom these small beginnings, Northwestern has developed into a leading private research university with a strong interdisciplinary culture and a commitment to teaching excellence. It now consists of 12 separate schools and colleges and is notable for its research strength in fields including neuroscience, nanotechnology, biotechnology and the development of new drugs. The main campus is still based at Evanston, 10 miles north of Chicago, although there is a smaller one in Chicago, so students enjoy all the stimulus and opportunities for personal and professional development provided by one of the world’s great cities. Since 2008, there has also been a third, satellite campus in Doha, Qatar.\nNorthwestern’s mascot is Willy the Wildcat. Its mottoes are both taken from the New Testament and read, in Latin and Greek, “Whatsoever things are true” and “The world is full of grace and truth”.\nCelebrated alumni include novelist Saul Bellow and economist George Stigler, who both went on to win Nobel Prizes, as well as Friends star David Schwimmer, Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn, and George R. R. Martin, whose novels inspired the Game of Thrones television series. No fewer than four economists and one chemist who worked as faculty at Northwestern went to receive Nobel Prizes. And the diplomat and political scientist Ralph Bunce, who had been a researcher there, went on to become the first African American to win a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n",

The merger, incorporating Southeastern’s schools of Osteopathic Medicine, Pharmacy, Optometry and Allied Health, created an emphasis on medicine and associated disciplines still evident in 2019 in eight out of its 18 schools including the School of Allopathic Medicine, which opened in 2017.\nMost of the 20,793 students enrolled in 2019 were based at the 314 acre Davie Campus, next to Florida Atlantic University. There are seven satellite sites elsewhere in Florida, plus a Puerto Rico campus opened in 2014.\nIn 2016 Times Higher Education listed it among 20 universities capable of becoming world-renowned by 2030 The university also garnered a lot of attention through its  \"Be Dominant\" branding, speaking of the \"NSU Edge\" and using images of sharks – the nickname of the university sports teams playing in NCAA Division II.\nThere are notable research strengths in oceanography and coral reefs. In 2008 the university hosted one of the world’s largest ever symposia on reefs, with representatives from 75 countries. A recurring $15m federal grant for work on reefs has been central to the work of the Centre for Excellence for Coral Reef Ecosystems Science Research, a $50m facility.\nThe campus has hosted pre-season training for the Miami Dolphins National Football League team since 1993 and alumni include baseball player JD Martinez, a 2018 World Series winner with the Boston Red Sox.\n",

            "description": "Princeton is one of the oldest universities in the US and is regarded as one of the world’s most illustrious higher education institutions.\nFounded in 1746 as the College of New Jersey, it was officially renamed Princeton University in 1896 in honour of the area where it is based, opening its famous graduate school in 1900.\nAcclaimed for its commitment to teaching, the Ivy League institution offers residential accommodation to all of its undergraduates across all four years of study, with 98 per cent of undergraduates living on campus.\nIts student body is relatively small, with fewer than 10,000 in total, and international students make up 12 per cent of undergraduates.\nPrinceton is also one of the world’s foremost research universities with connections to more than 40 Nobel laureates, 17 winners of the National Medal of Science and five recipients of the National Humanities Medal.\nFaculty members who have been awarded a Nobel prize in recent years include chemists Tomas Lindahl and Osamu Shimomura, economists Paul Krugman and Angus Deaton and physicists Arthur McDonald and David Gross.\nNotable alumni who have won a Nobel prize include the physicists Richard Feynman and Robert Hofstadter and chemists Richard Smalley and Edwin McMillan.\nPrinceton has also educated two US presidents, James Madison and Woodrow Wilson, who was also the university’s president prior to entering the White House. Other distinguished graduates include Michelle Obama, actors Jimmy Stewart and Brooke Shields, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Apollo astronaut Pete Conrad.\nPrinceton, which is consistently ranked among the world’s top 10 universities, is renowned for its campus’ park-like beauty as well as some of its landmark buildings, designed by some of America’s most well-known architects. For instance, its Lewis Library was designed by Frank Gehry and contains many of the university’s science collections. Its McCarter Theatre Center has won a Tony Award for the best regional theatre in the country.\nSpread across 500 acres, the Princeton campus has about 180 buildings, including 10 libraries containing about 14 million holdings. It is popular with visitors, with about 800,000 people visiting its open campus each year, generating about $2 billion in revenue.\nThe Princeton area, which has a population of about 30,000 residents, is also something of a destination itself, with many attracted by its tree-lined streets and wide variety of shops, restaurants and parks.\nThe university is within easy reach of both New York City and Philadelphia, with the “Dinky” shuttle train providing a regular service lasting about one hour to both cities. Princeton regularly subsidises many student trips to concerts, plays and athletic events in the two cities.\n",

            "description": "Reed College was constructed in 1908 in the city of Portland, Oregon, USA. The university was founded with money donated by Simon and Amanda Reed. Mr Reed was a successful trader and when he died left instructions in his will to spend some of his estate on something which would “be of permanent value and contribute to the beauty of the city”. Amanda reed used the money to found Reed college. The college has always been non-sectarian, coeducational and egalitarian, and where other liberal arts colleges were established following the model of the larger, Ivy League universities, Reed was set up explicitly in reaction to this type of education. As such the university does not have any exclusive social clubs, fraternities or varsity athletics – devoting itself primarily to academia.\nThis approach has led to a reputation for academic achievement among Reed students with 50 Fulbright Scholars, 60 Watson Fellows, 2 MacArthur Fellows, and 31 Rhodes Scholars to its name. All freshmen year students take a compulsory humanities course, designed to give science and humanities students alike a grounding in the Classics. There is also a de-emphasis on grades at the university with a more narrative style of assessment. The college offers five humanities courses, 26 majors, 12 interdisciplinary majors and six dual-degrees offered with other institutions. Academics are divided into five divisions within the college: Division of Arts, Division of History and Social Sciences, Division of Literature and Languages, Division of Mathematics and Natural Sciences and the Division of Philosophy, Religion, Psychology, and Linguistics.\n",

            "description": "Rice University is an intimately sized research university in the heart of Houston, Texas, with a focus on undergraduates and a reputation for unconventional thinking.\nEdgar Odell Lovett , the first president of Rice, said “[We must] keep the standards up and the numbers down”, and even today there are only a few thousand students.Lovett introduced a college system whereby students and faculty would live, eat and learn in the same environment.\nOver 70% of undergraduates and nearly all first year students live on the 300-acre campus and everybody is a member of one of 11 co-ed colleges. There are no sororities or fraternities and students of different majors and ages live together.\nRice has eight schools of Architecture, Continuing Studies, Engineering, Humanities, Business, Music, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences, with an undergraduate student-to-faculty ratio of 6 to 1 and a median undergraduate class size of 14.\nSince Rice’s inception, exams have not been proctored as students are trusted not to cheat.\nRice’s history dates back to 1891 when businessman William Marsh Rice created a charter for the William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature, which required that the institute would begin only after his death.\nIn 1900 he was murdered by his valet, who planned and failed to inherit his estate using a forged will, and in 1912 the institute was born with 77 students, including women, and 12 members of faculty.\nResearch is not just for faculty members, as over half of the university’s undergraduates also take part, and Rice has been instrumental in the creation of nanotechnology, artificial hearts and Buckyballs.\nRice alumni include several US Congressmen and Cabinet Secretaries, nine astronauts, nine Major League Baseball players, two Nobel Laureates and four fictional literary characters.\nThe university has a tradition of elaborate practical jokes, the most famous being in 1988 when three engineers, three scientists and an English major developed a successful plan to rotate the university’s 2,000 pound statue of William Marsh Rice by 180 degrees.\nRice’s many wacky rituals include the Beer Bike intramural race and drinking competition dating from the opening of the residential colleges in 1957. However, because of a change in alcohol laws, most students now drink water instead of beer.\n",

            "description": "Rider University was founded in 1865 as Trenton Business College in the city of Trenton, New Jersey, USA. Andrew Rider was named the college’s first president and it was named after him the year before he stepped down in 1898. Women began attending in 1896 and the college continued to grow. In 1922 the college won accreditation to grant bachelor’s degrees in accounting and commercial science. The college began to broaden its curriculum beyond business, opening its liberal arts program in 1957. The college continued to grow and in 1959 facilities were moved to a new 208-acre suburban campus in Lawrence Township. As well as moving to a new campus the college also began a process of dividing its academic program into distinct schools and the process was complete in the early 1960s. Rider incorporated Westminster Choir College in 1991 and changed its name to Rider University in 1994.\nToday Rider University has upwards of 5,000 students studying a wide range of postgraduate and undergraduate qualifications across five academic schools over two campuses. The student body is diverse, with people from 77 different countries choosing to study at Rider. The university offers over 60 majors across its five schools: the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business Administration, the Department of Graduate Education and the Department of Journalism and Communications.\nThe main campus is in the suburban district of Lawrenceville between the cities of Trenton and Princeton. The campus is green and wooded with landscaped lawns and a lake. There are numerous academic residential and administration buildings at the Lawrenceville campus and most of the university’s undergraduate programs are based there. Princeton campus (formerly the Westminster Choir School) specialises in musical education.\n",

            "description": "Roger Williams University (RWU) is a liberal arts university in the city of Bristol, Rhode Island, USA. The University was founded in 1956 although it can trace its history back to 1919 when Northeastern University opened a branch in the YMCA in the city of Providence, Rhode Island. The branch was run by the YMCA from 1940 onwards and the institution began awarding associate degrees in 1948. The school received a charter in 1956 and became the Roger Williams Junior College, and the college began awarding bachelor’s degrees in the 1960s. The college moved to a new waterfront campus in 1969 to accommodate its growing student population. The name changed again to Roger Williams University in 1992 and since that time it has been steadily increasing student enrolment and widening its curriculum.\nToday RWU is a private coeducational liberal arts university with in the region of 5,000 students. There are a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses on offer with the most popular being management and marketing, business, architecture and law enforcement. There are around 50 majors available and the academic programs are split into eight schools: business, arts and sciences, architecture, art and historic preservation, engineering, computing, construction and management, justice studies, education, continuing studies and law.\nThe campus covers 140 waterfront acres in the town of Bristol and 30 minutes from the cities of Providence and Newport. There are six residence halls on campus and the college’s main academic and administrative buildings are all located here as well as sports and leisure facilities and the university library, ATMs and dining facilities.\n",

Students are able to study abroad for between a semester and a year of their course, with opportunities available in more than 40 countries across the world.\nThe 80-acre university campus is located in Newport, Rhode Island, in the city’s Bellevue Avenue Historic District and spread across seven estates. Among some of the notable on-campus buildings are Ochre Court, the university’s first home, as well as Gothic-style Munroe Center, the red sandstone mansion McAuley Hall, and Wakehurst, an enormous, Elizabethan-style manor house built in 1887 and home to a range of student activities.\nMore than half of the student population live on-campus in one of the varied range of residence halls.\nNotable former students include actress Betty Hutton, former President & CEO of The New York Times Company, Janet L. Robinson, Chaplain of the United States Senate, Barry C. Black, and former Commander in Chief of the US Central Command, Anthony Zinni.\n",

Just 13 years after it was founded a fire destroyed the college, and in 1887 it moved from Marion to East Lake. Over the next decade the university gradually became coeducational, with Anna Judge becoming the first female graduate in 1896.\nIn 1957 the campus was relocated to Homewood, and eight years later the institution received university status, adopting a new name in honour of insurance executive and longtime trustee Frank Park Samford Sr.\nToday the university offers 30 undergraduate and graduate degrees, as well as 158 undergraduate majors, minors and concentrations. The university is made up of ten academic schools, all of which are located on the scenic 200-acre campus just outside Birmingham, Alabama’s most populous city.\nMost of the 50+ university buildings are built in a Georgian Colonial style and it is widely regarded as one of the most stunning university campuses in the state.\nAmong the notable former students are Cordell Hull, the longest-serving Secretary of State in US history, world-leading soprano Elizabeth Futral, Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper editor Harold E. Martin as well as renowned American football coach, Bobby Bowden.\n",

It is the third largest university in the state of California. \nStarting out with just seven faculty and 91 students meeting above a downtown drugstore, it is now a public research university that has around 7,700 faculty and staff and more than 35,000 students. \nIn its early days, the curriculum was limited to the study of English, history and mathematics. The modern SDSU now offers a vast range of subjects, comprising 91 undergraduate courses, 78 masters’ programmes and 22 doctoral degrees. \nThe university has a broad international outlook. Over 2,000 of its students annually take advantage of the 400 or so programs it offers in 67 countries worldwide. Additionally, SDSU welcomes more than 2,300 international students each year to its institution from a large variety of countries including China, Saudi Arabia and many European countries. \nSDSU is a State Grant University and has been classified as a “research high” university by the Carnegie Foundation. It particularly prides itself on the programs it offers in business, engineering, public health and education, among others. \nSince 2000 it has received more than $1 billion in grants and from other contracts, to be used for research and programme administration. It spends roughly $120 million a year on research.\nMany of the university’s buildings are listed on the national register of historic places, including the central Hepner Hall, which can also be found on the university’s emblem and seal. \nThe university is also home to the Malcolm A. Love library, which comprises more than two million books, around 140,000 e-books, a modern media centre and 24/7 study rooms. It also acts as both a state and federal depository library. \nSDSU has an alumni network more than 280,000 strong. Some notable people that went to the university include American actors Gregory Peck and Raquel Welch, and the CEO of Costco, Jim Sinegal.\n",

Spencer and Patricia Standish Library and the Marcelle Athletic Complex.\nThe university sports teams, known as the Siena Saints, compete in the NCAA Division I with the most well known team being the men’s basketball squad, who have appeared in six NCAA Tournaments and have produced players including Marcus Faison and Kenny Hasbrouck.\nOther notable former students include Pulitzer Prize-winning author William J Kennedy, FoxNews correspondent Ed Henry, George Deukmejian, the 35th Governor of California as well as Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association.\n",

            "description": "St Bonaventure University is a Catholic affiliated university on a 500 acre campus in Allegany, southwestern New York state. The university is named for a Franciscan monk and scholar who served as a close friend of Thomas Aquinas. Founded in 1858, its motto is ‘Becoming Extraordinary’.\nThere are over 50 academic programmes available at St Bonaventure, in the Schools of Arts & Sciences, Business, Education, and Communication. Graduate programmes are offered at a satellite campuses in Olean and within the Buffalo Centre of Hilbert college, as well as courses offered online or in hybrid format. The school of Franciscan Studies also runs a summer programme on campus, providing a continuing education based around religious and spiritual traditions.\nClare College is the administrative arm of the university, and provides a core curriculum to students based in interdisciplinary liberal arts study and academic endeavour in the spirit of Bonaventure himself.\nApproximately 75% of students live on campus. Residences are divided between freshman and upper-class housing, and Living & Learning communities grouping people together with common interests, such as religious and spiritual traditions at Assisi House, academic major houses, and residences for quiet study or substance free zones.\nAthletics teams are known as the Bonnies, and compete in the NCAA Division I. There are eight women’s sports programmes including lacrosse and nine men’s, including rugby. Opened in 1966, the Reilly Centre is the home to Bonnies basketball teams and university events, and such is the popularity of games it is designed to seat almost twice the amount of students attending the university.\nAmong the many esteemed alumni of St Bonaventure are five members of Congress, and six Pulitzer Prize winning journalists.\n",

It was a two-year college between 1954 and 1984, when it launched four-year courses. The university now offers undergraduate, postgraduate and adult education courses. Previously Villa Julie College, it has been known by its current name since 2008.\nStevenson’s programmes provide students with a grounding in liberal arts but also maintain a career focus, preparing graduates for the jobs market. \nIts Greenspring Campus, the first Stevenson site in existence, is 60 acres in size, mostly consisting of science labs and studios. It is located 15 miles north west of Baltimore, the state’s largest metropolis, a port city rich in culture, arts and sport.\nStevenson’s Owings Mills Campus, located six miles west, is the base of the School of Graduate and Professional Studies, the Brown School of Business and Leadership, halls of residence, sports facilities and other student-led activities. More than four in five Stevenson students are from Maryland, with just under half living on campus. Initially a religious institution, Stevenson, which was founded by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, became independent of the Catholic Church in 1967.\n",

In 1996, it incorporated the New England School of Art & Design.\nOne of the best institutions in New England, Suffolk has been hailed for its student engagement and career preparation in particular. Its business and engineering programmes are among the most highly regarded, while its present-day law school is also viewed positively.\nA stone’s throw from Boston Common, the university is a short walk from the Old State House, Faneuil and Boston Celtics’ basketball arena. The most famous and heavily populated city on the East Coast, Boston is where the American Revolution began, and one of the country’s oldest cities. Yet it is now fast-establishing itself as one of the most modern. The city centre has undergone considerable development in recent years, with new skyscrapers, tech investment, refurbished parks and some neighbourhoods even built from scratch, like Fan Pier. But it retains its reputation as a cultural hub, home to famous museums, iconic sports grounds, a lively theatre and music scene, and all kinds of culinary delights. As well as nine buildings in the centre of Boston, Suffolk also enjoys satellite campuses in Cape Cod, a famous Massachusetts coastal strip, and Madrid, the Spanish capital.\nAlumni include Joan Vennochi, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who spent years at the Boston Globe, and Dan Harrington, a world champion poker player who has also played chess and backgammon at international level.\n",

His vision for the institution was to provide educational opportunities for talented and motivated students, regardless of background or means.\nIn 1965, it was designated as a “state-related” institution, having previously been private.\nTemple’s more than 35,000 students continue to follow its official motto – “Perseverantia Vincit”, or “Perseverance Conquers”.\nThe university has nine campuses – ranging across urban and suburban Philadelphia to branches in Rome and Japan. Its main campus is in the heart of the Philadelphia, the largest city in Pennsylvania and the fifth largest in the US.\nTemple has traditionally been known for the high level of ethnic diversity among its student body.\nTemple has a reputation as a leader in professional education, being among the largest US universities in terms of numbers educated in the combined fields of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, podiatry and law.\nThe Temple University Hospital, a 571-bed teaching hospital, is the chief clinical training site for Temple University School of Medicine.\nNotable Temple alumni include comedian and actor Kevin Hart, singer Jill Scott, musicians Daryl Hall and John Oates, and former Princeton University president Shirley J. Tilghman.\nThe Temple “T” is the symbol of the university. The logo was designed by students in the university’s Tyler School of Art in 1983.\nIn honour of Temple’s origins as a night school for ambitious young people, the owl became its mascot. Hooter the Owl makes appearances at football and basketball games, as well as at alumni events.\nAt sports games, Temple’s most ardent fans are known as “the Cherry Crusade” – a group made up of students who paint themselves in Temple colours and lead cheers.\n",

It changed its name to Texas Tech University in 1969.\nToday, the university is home to 10 separate colleges, including colleges of Architecture, Arts and Sciences, Education, Media and Communication, and Visual and Performing Arts, as well as a Graduate School and a School of Law.\nIt offers 150 undergraduate degrees, 100 master’s and 50 doctoral degrees.\nThe university’s total research expenditures exceeded $150 million in 2014, and in the year before that, 10 of its faculty members were bestowed grants from the Fulbright US Scholar Programme – the biggest number of any research university in the nation.\nThe university’s official motto is “From here, it’s possible.”\nTTU’s athletics teams are known as Red Raiders. Sporting the colours scarlet and black, their mascots are The Masked Rider and Raider Red. At football games, fans sing The Texas Tech Fight Song.\nAmong the university’s traditions are Arbor Day, when students plant trees on campus, and the Carol of Lights, where 25,000 lights illuminate the campus buildings and choirs perform at the Science Quadrangle.\nFormer students of the university include the late singer-songwriter and activist John Denver, and the late American journalist and writer Grace Halsell.\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, TTU is ranked in the Top 25 US institutions producing the graduates most sought after by government and corporate employers.\n",

            "description": "Predating the state from which it takes its name, the University of Arizona is a leading research institution located in the city of Tucson.\nFunding for the university was allocated in 1885 – when Arizona was just a territory of the US, not a full state – in a step that was regarded as a poor deal by Tucson’s residents, who had hoped to receive the more lucrative appropriation to build a mental hospital instead.\nAmid this reluctance, finding land for the university was a challenge, until two professional gamblers and a saloon keeper were persuaded to donate a patch of desert; allowing construction to begin in 1887, and classes to begin in 1891.\nSince then, the university has expanded to cover more than 380 acres of central Tucson, with much of the campus having been designated as an arboretum because of the rare trees that it holds. Almost all of the university’s buildings are characterised by the use of red bricks, particularly in facades.\nThe university is divided into a number of colleges, and boasts two medical schools, as well as the Banner-University Medical Center, which is rated as one of the best hospitals in the US.\nAmong the colleges is the University of Arizona Honors College, which aims to provide an experience similar to a liberal arts college, with more than 4,500 students.\nThe university is home to seven libraries and nine museums, including the Arizona State Museum and Biosphere 2, described as a “world under glass”, holding a living rainforest and an “ocean” in glass domes.\nThe university is renowned for its research impact, and a particular research strength is space science, with the institution claiming to have been awarded more Nasa grants than any other university in the US.\nOverall, the university receives more than $580 million (£402 million) in research funding every year. In turn, through knowledge transfer and technology parks, the university estimates that it supports $8.3 billion of economic activity in Arizona every year.\nSports teams and alumni of the university are known as “Wildcats”, and the institution’s motto is “Bear Down, Arizona” – the last words of revered American football quarterback John “Button” Salmon, in 1926.\nNotable alumni of the university include late US presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, Sesame Street co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney, and Nobel prizewinning astrophysicist Brian Schmidt.\nAlumni who have made a career in entertainment include actor Greg Kinnear, actress Kristen Wiig and reality television star Kourtney Kardashian.\n",

The other four campuses can be found across the state in Wilmington, Dover, Georgetown and Lewes.\nThe library collection includes nearly three million books and bound periodicals as well as over 500,000 electronic books and journals. In addition to this, it is a depository for US government publications, meaning they are accessible to the public for free.\nMuch to the benefit of its College of Earth, Ocean and Environment, the university has its own 146-foot vessel called the Hugh R. Sharp. Named after a previous trustee of the university who had a passion for marine studies, the research vessel is the most advanced in the US and can carry up to 20 scientists on coastal research cruises of up to 18 days.\nBack on land, the university also has its own High Performance Figure Skating Centre where some of the best figure skaters in the world flock to train.\nIncluded among its alumni are three signatories of the Declaration of Independence and one of the US Constitution, all from the university’s first intake. Today, its 160,000-strong alumni of ‘living Blue Hens’ (named after the university’s sports teams) include Nobel prize winners, Guggenheim and Fulbright fellows and members of various prominent scientific bodies such as the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe Carnegie Foundation has classified the University of Delaware as a research university.\n",

All are stand-alone universities.\nThe University of Houston educates almost 50,000 students each year on both online and campus courses, of which there are about 300. It awards more than 8,000 degrees every year and has about 230,000 alumni.\nStarting out as a junior college, it was formally recognised as a university in 1933. A law school was included more than a decade later, and today there are 25 research centres across its 667 acre campus.\nThere are a number of green spaces, sculptures and fountains, with buildings designed by both César Pelli and Philip Johnson.\nNotable faculty staff include the playwright and three-time Pulitzer Prize winner Edward Albee, physics professor and National Medal of Science recipient Paul Chu and political activist and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Jody Williams.\nThe student body is the second most ethnically diverse of all major research universities in the US, according to the university, hailing from 137 nations. It has some 500 student organisations and 16 intercollegiate sports teams, with about 6,000 students living on campus. Of its alumni, about 63 per cent live in the Houston area and 75 per cent live in the rest of Texas.\nIt had an endowment fund of about $700 million in 2013 and research expenditure of $141 million in 2014, with more than 40 research labs, centres and institutes.\nNotable alumni include Bonnie J. Dunbar, a former Nasa astronaut, Alice Sebold, author of The Lovely Bones, and Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America.\n",

            "description": "The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is the city’s only public research university. It grew out of the Chicago College of Pharmacy, founded in 1859, after which it joined forces with other medical colleges in the region.\nAlthough UIC’s origins are rooted in healthcare – the university lays claim to the largest medical school in the US – its 15 colleges offer programmes spanning liberal arts, social work and engineering, as well as sciences and health.\nThe institution now comprises over 29,000 students and is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse student bodies in America. \nUIC’s first campus, at the junction of the Greektown and Little Italy districts of Chicago, meant that many students were the first in their families to attend college (and still remain so, to this day).\nDuring a period of rapid student expansion in the 1960s, the renowned Chicago architect Walter Netsch was asked to design buildings that would accommodate a growing student community in what was a small area of land. His response was to construct them in a series of concentric rings, the inspiration for which was a droplet of water.\nNetsch’s brutalist style dominates UIC’s east campus, which is nicknamed ‘Circle’ after the major expressway that runs alongside it.\nExtra-curricular activities at UIC are in plentiful supply. Sports facilities include a gym, volleyball and racquetball courts, running paths, climbing walls and an outdoor field complex comprising 214,000 square feet of synthetic turf for soccer and baseball games. A separate outdoor facility has tennis and basketball courts, along with swimming pools, saunas and a wellness centre.\nAt the beginning of each academic year, UIC also hosts a free ‘back to school’ music festival on campus exclusively for students. A 10,000-seater, multi-purpose arena on campus allows for easy access to other major concerts and productions, while a contemporary art space, called Gallery 400, is at the centre of the Chicago arts scene.\nAway from campus, UIC students have the opportunity to take part in one of the university’s many study abroad programmes that include, among other things, interning at the German Bundestag and working for a member of the German Parliament.\n",

KU was established under a Morrill Land Grant – a scheme whereby land owned by the United States Federal Government was gifted to states so that they could sell it to raise money for university endowments. Today UK is a major public university with around 30,000 students and a commitment to becoming one of the USA’s top 20 public research institutions by 2020.\nUK is the largest university in the state of Kentucky with 16 colleges (most of which were founded in the first half of the 20th century) and a graduate school. These offer around 90 undergraduate programs, nearly 100 masters programs and 66 doctoral programs. UK is rapidly growing its population of international students with around 120 countries represented in its student body.\nThe university has a proud athletic record and UK’s sporting teams, ‘The Wildcats’ are represented in men’s and women’s basketball, American football and baseball.

            "description": "Founded in 1893, the University of Montana (UM) is a public research university situated in Missoula, Montana’s second-largest city.\nSpanning 56 acres in the western portion of the state, the university has several campuses in Missoula, as well as in Helena, Butte and Dillon.\nIts main Missoula campus is located at the base of Mount Sentinel along the Clark Fork River. It features over 60 architecturally important buildings, parkland and a 25,000+ seat football stadium. While UM’s South Campus offers student housing, soccer fields, a golf course and outdoor track facilities on a 180-acre site\nHome to approximately 15,000 students, UM and Missoula College, which runs programmes in occupational and technical subjects, offers a wide range of courses, including liberal arts, graduate and postdoctoral study, and professional training.\nKnown as ‘a city within a city’, the university’s grounds gives students access to their own restaurants, medical facilities, postal services, banks, and even a police department.\nThe university counts a number of recognisable names among its alumni, including Jeannette Pickering Rankin, who in 1916 became the first woman to hold a high office in the US government, as well as the award-winning actor JK Simmons.\nAs the fourth largest state in the nation, Montana itself is renowned for its striking scenery, vast National Parks (including Yellowstone), glaciers, mountains and abundant wildlife. Rolling Stone magazine once described UM as having ‘the most scenic campus in America’.\nIn addition to a wide range of outdoor pursuits, UM also offers students athletics matches and art exhibitions on campus, as well as a wide range of public events.\nThe campus itself is well known for its life-size statue of a grizzly bear created by the sculptor and UM professor, Rudy Autio, in 1969 that stands seven feet tall and weighs 5000 pounds.\nUM’s athletics teams are known as the Grizzlies. Their mascot is Monte (short for Montana) the bear, who shows up at football games and undertakes charitable works in the community.\n",

Willard Marriott, founder of the Marriott hotel chain.\nAttractions on campus include the Utah Museum of Fine Arts, the Natural History Museum of Utah and the Red Butte Garden and Arboretum, which doubles as a concert venue in summer.\nSince 1907, a giant stone “U” has overlooked the campus from Mount Van Cott, at a height of 1600 metres, with lights that flash when the university’s sports teams win.\nThe university’s sports teams take the name “Utes” – and have done so with the support of the Ute Indian Tribe, which gives the state and institution their names, since 1972.\nThe university encourages supporters of its sports team to show understanding and respect towards the people of the tribe.\n",

            "description": "Wagner College is a private institution in New York City which is best-known for its liberal arts provision. Founded in 1883, the institution’s roots lie in Rochester, on the other side of the state, but it has been based in Staten Island, one of NYC’s five boroughs, since 1918. It became coeducational in 1933.\nMore than two-thirds of Wagner students live on its campus, which comprises more than 100 acres on the north west of the island, two miles from the free ferry that connects it to Manhattan. It enjoys excellent views of the sea and the city skyline.\nWagner is ranked among the North East’s 25 best regional colleges, and has also been praised for its affordability and community service roles. Psychology, nursing, business administration and arts administration are among the most popular courses, but its theatrical and medical programmes have received extra credit. Wagner’s campus has been used to shoot various films and television shows, including School of Rock, The Sopranos and Law & Order.\nWagner alumni include the actor Robert Loggia, who appeared in Scarface, Independence Day and Revenge of the Pink Panther among other films, and TV shows like Columbo, Frasier and Malcolm in the Middle, and CSI: NY star Carmine Giovinazzo, who played Danny Messer in the crime series. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Paul Zindel and Major League Baseball pitcher Andrew Bailey, an all-star who has played for the Oakland Athletics, the Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Anaheim Angels, are just some of the others.\n",

Although throughout its history the college was associated with the Missouri Baptist Convention, the institution has been independent since 2003.\nWilliam Jewell offers majors in a wide variety of subjects. In addition, the college has an Oxbridge Honors programme in history, history of ideas, institutions and policy, literature and theory, music and molecular biology. This gives students the opportunity to study in Oxford or Cambridge for one year.\nThe student to faculty ratio is 10 to one and 65 per cent of classes have fewer than 20 students. \nStudent athletes compete in 20 varsity sports, including baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field and volleyball. These sports compete at the NCAA Division II level in the Great Lakes Valley Conference.\nWilliam Jewell’s campus combines urban and rural landscapes, and is not far from Kansas City, which offers cultural activities, a busy night life and internship and job opportunities.\n \n",

Williams College also offers graduate programmes in history of art and development economics.\nThe institution has a seven to one student to faculty ratio, which is significantly lower than most universities. \nThe institution says it is a needs-blind college as it admits US students regardless of their ability to pay. This translates into a 50 per cent rate of students who receive financial aid.\nThe undergraduate student body is formed of about 8 per cent international students and 36 per cent US students from minority backgrounds.\nFamous alumni include Pulitzer Prize winner for history James Phinney Baxter III, Elia Kazan, writer and Academy Award winning director of Gentleman’s Agreement and A Streetcar Named Desire, and Richard Helms, director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n \n",
